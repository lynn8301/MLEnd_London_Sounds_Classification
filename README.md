# MLEnd London Sounds Classification
The mini-project has two separate components:

1.   **Basic component**: Using the MLEnd London Sounds dataset, build a machine learning pipeline that takes as an input an audio segment and predicts whether the audio segment has been recorded indoors or outdoors.
2.   **Advanced component** : Formulate your own machine learning problem and build a machine learning solution using the MLEnd London Sounds dataset.
